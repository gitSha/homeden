###At first I created a repertory using name homeden.Than I created a folder with same name homeden on the desktop, on that folder I included a file README.md,commit and pushed that file to the repertory using Git Bash. Open that README.md file from the repository and included my name and the steps that I followed. There are also other way to do this process. To do these above process, I opened a github account, download git in my local machine, created folders in windows file system and use git bash to write commands, also In the future, I can use these files to write git codes and other languages to create pages, I can use git inside Eclipse or Visual Basics or other tools for advanced level works :)
