## At first I created a repertory using name homeden.  
Than I created a folder with same name homeden on the desktop, on that folder I included a file README.md , 
commit and pushed that file to my repertory using Git Bash. Open that README.md folder with notepad included
my name and the steps that I followed. There are also other way to do this process. 
In the future I can use that files to write html like GIT codes to create pages.
